# Word-Guessing-Game
Word Guessing Game
Game Objective and Rules:
The objective of the Word Guessing Game is to guess the correct word within a given number of tries. Players are provided with a set of blank spaces representing the letters of the word. With each incorrect guess, the number of tries decreases. Hints are provided to make guessing easier. The game concludes when the player successfully guesses the word or runs out of tries.

# Design and Development Process Report - 

## Introduction 
   Creating a web-based game is a complex task that involves a variety of skills, from programming 
   languages to teamwork. Our team embarked on a five-week journey to develop a word-guessing 
   game. Along the way, we faced numerous challenges, overcame obstacles, and learned valuable 
   lessons. 
   **Week 1: Foundations** 
   During the first week, we focused on building a solid foundation. Recognizing our limited 
   experience in website development, we dove into the basics of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This 
   week was crucial in ensuring that every team member had a good grasp of web development 
   fundamentals. 
   **Week 2: Setting the Blueprint** 
   In Week 2, we started with a template from Coding Nepal and began enhancing its features. We 
   divided responsibilities among team members, with each member responsible for curating 
   questions, hints, and images for four different categories. We also started using GitHub, which 
   came with its challenges, especially with Git Bash. However, our determination and collaboration 
   helped us get comfortable with essential git commands. 
   **Week 3: Building the Structure** 
   Week 3 marked the transition from planning to actual development. We designed the main 
   interface of our game, introducing two crucial HTML pages: home.html, displaying categories, 
   and movie.html, showing questions related to the chosen category. 
   **Week 4: Adding Logic and Style** 
   The core functionality of the game came into play during Week 4 through two JavaScript files: 
   word.js and script.js. The former contained questions, answers, and hints, while the latter handled 
   game logic, including score calculation and question randomization. We also improved the user 
   experience by integrating the Intro Js library and started refining the game's appearance with CSS. 
   **Week 5: Testing and Deployment** 
   We initiated an extensive testing phase to identify and fix any bugs in our codebase. Issues were 
   found in both word.js and script.js and were promptly addressed. We implemented cookies to 
   ensure that Introjs loaded only for first-time players. After thorough testing, we were confident in 
   the stability and functionality of our game, leading us to host it on GitHub Pages. 
# Reflections 
**What Worked?** We successfully identified and resolved the UI issues in the initial template. We 
replaced intrusive alert messages with user-friendly notifications and ensured that the game 
provided a score even if the user answered incorrectly. 
**What Didn't Work?** Our ambitious plans to incorporate confetti.js animations and potentially 
switch to advanced frameworks like ReactJS or Angular were hindered by time constraints and 
our learning curve. 
# Lessons Learned 
1. User-Centric Design: Prioritizing a user-friendly and enjoyable experience is crucial. 
2. Flexibility: Being adaptable in the face of challenges, especially when dealing with new 
technologies or unexpected issues, is essential. 
3. Testing: Regularly testing the product is vital for delivering a polished and bug-free game. 
4. Teamwork: Effective collaboration and clear communication are the foundations of a successful 
project. 
5. Documentation: Maintaining clear documentation is helpful for troubleshooting and future 
improvements. 
6. Collaboration: Tools like GitHub facilitate a collaborative environment, allowing for efficient 
version control and collective contributions. 
7. Technical Knowledge: Understanding technical aspects, from programming languages like 
JavaScript to version control systems like Git, is of utmost importance. 
In conclusion, our journey was characterized by continuous learning, teamwork, and problem
solving. We not only created a functional web-based game but also gained valuable skills and 
insights that will undoubtedly benefit us in future projects.
